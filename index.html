        <p>
            I am interested in collage, doll making and photography. While making artworks, I love to include various materials instead of only illustration. 
            What's more, I have an obsession with bunny that I carry a bunny doll while traveling and taking pictures for it. 
            There are lots of things that fascinates me: museums, abandoned places, old dolls, vintages and Polaroid. 
            I also practiced wood cutting, sewing and other skills in BFA studies.
