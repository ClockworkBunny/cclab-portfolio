My design sketch was a rabbit having a face that seems unhappy. Its emotions are changing while the user using the mouse to hollow.
Firstly I made the face of this rabbit. Then I made the eyes and mouth. I looked up at an tutorial to make the mouth changes shape while moving the cursor. I made the eyes moving along afterwards. 
I tired to make the face size change but then I delated it, since there is too much changes going on which is a little bit overwhlemed.
I added the nose, which did not show in the sketch. I made the nose changing into an ramdom size while the mouse is pressed so that it looked funnnier.
I learnt it is important to experimenting and combine the effects, because things sometimes does not look good while u doing them according to the plan. I have made some changes while making the face and I consider it is better than what I planned at the begining. There are some effects that generated and seems quiet good, for example the eyes looked like they are chasing the nose.
